# Trybe Projects

Here you can find some exercises and projects that I did studying web development at Trybe, the structure of this repository is as follows:

There are 4 main modules, where each one have their own 'blocks'. In each block you can find one main theme, with an 'caderninho.txt' file, it is where I made my studying notes, so there you will find my thought and learning process. In each block there is also a project that manifests the skills that I learned in the block, where you can find my code and a LIVE version of the project. 

There is also an disclaimer that needs to be made, there are some snippets of code in some projects that Trybe provided and were not entirely created by me. I always try to signal it in the README when it happens.

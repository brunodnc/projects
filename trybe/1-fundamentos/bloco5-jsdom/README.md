Here in this block we learned about HTML events and local storage manipulation, in the exercises folder you can find a cool calendar and a cool events exercise, there is also an CCSless to-do-list ;). 

There is also an practice project that I am very proud of called css-text-editor where I use localStorage to remember the CSS configuration from user input.

There was three projects in this block: 

pixels-art
An block-board where you can make your own pixel art :)

mystery-letter
If you need to write an anonymous with letters cut directly from some maganizes, do not worry, you can now do it online :)

meme-generator
Generate your own meme

--

guess-the-color

is an unfinished game project where the user needs to guess the color, but there is a secret to it, one of the borders says to the user what is the right answer, so you can make your friends believe that you are good at guessing :)

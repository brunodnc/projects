This was a very interesting block, and the practical project was done with another student, so I cannot claim the sole ownership to the code.

Trybewarts is the name of the harry potter themed project that we did, that is basically a form that returns a profile card, I did this project with Caio Alves... couldn't find his github profile link, will search for it later!
